Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, easy dark chocolate cupcakes. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Turn on the mixer at low speed to combine the dry and wet ingredients. Be careful not to overmix, just stir until clumps of flour and other dry ingredients are mixed in. Texture: The dark chocolate cupcake&#39;s texture is soft, airy, and sponge-y- not at all dense like our homemade brownies recipe and since they&#39;re made with oil, they are much fluffier than our buttery vanilla cupcakes. No waiting for butter to soften, no creaming, the batter is simple and quick to make.
