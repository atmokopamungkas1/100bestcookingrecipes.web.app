1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Stir in ground beef, tomato paste, chili powder, salt and celery seeds and cook until meat is browned. Add beans to meat mixture and simmer until thick. Loose Coney: Serve (almost) like they do in Detroit by topping a hot dog with Coney Sauce (no bean beef chili) and the Loose Meat. My Tommy&#39;s Chili is great substitute for Coney Sauce, especially if you add nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon. Seasonings: Instead of Worcestershire sauce, you can substitute soy sauce or beef broth.
