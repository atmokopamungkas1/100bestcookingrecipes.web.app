Hello everybody, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, roasted garlic hummus. One of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Cut off ¼-½&#34; from the top, or the &#34;stem&#34; end, of a garlic bulb (i.e. not the root) and place it on a piece of tin foil.
