I love making a big pot of healthy chicken chili this time of year. Blend the ingredients until they are well combined. Add chicken thighs and diced onions to slow cooker, pour tomatillo-chile sauce all over the top of the chicken and stir to combine. Place the tomatillos, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper, serrano pepper, onion, and whole unpeeled garlic cloves on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray.

Place the tomatillos, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper, serrano pepper, onion, and whole unpeeled garlic cloves on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. The big flavor boost in this chicken chili comes from salsa verde. Green salsa is LOADED with flavor from tomatillos, jalape√±o or chiles, cilantro, onion, etc. Using salsa instead of adding those ingredients individually to the soup saves lots of time without sacrificing flavor.
