You can use other types of ground meats as well. Onion - I find white or yellow onion works best. Garlic - Use as much or little as you like. The sauce starts out with a mixture of ground beef, ground pork and ground veal, which is sometimes labeled &#34;meatloaf mix&#34;; it&#39;s browned along with onions and garlic, and basil is thrown in for flavor.

The sauce starts out with a mixture of ground beef, ground pork and ground veal, which is sometimes labeled &#34;meatloaf mix&#34;; it&#39;s browned along with onions and garlic, and basil is thrown in for flavor. A good dose of red wine is stirred in to give the sauce some body and a little oomph. I especially love this over roasted spaghetti squash &#34;noodles&#34; with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and parsley. FYI to make spaghetti squash noodles; I cut a medium spaghetti squash in half, scoop out the seeds, place it cut-side down in a roasting pan and pour about a cup of water.
