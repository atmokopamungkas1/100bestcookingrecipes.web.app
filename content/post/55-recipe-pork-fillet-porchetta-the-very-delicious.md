##### Steps to make Pork Fillet Porchetta:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Porchetta is a wonderfully fatty and delicious boneless pork roast hailing from Italy. Traditionally, porchetta was made with a whole, deboned suckling pig. But now (at least here in North America) it&#39;s generally made with only the best part of the pig - rind on pork belly. In a small bowl, combine chopped rosemary, garlic, fennel seeds, lemon zest, salt, chile flakes and pepper. For the Tenderloin: Wrap the bacon slices around the tenderloin, tucking the ends underneath the pork so that the bacon stays in place.
