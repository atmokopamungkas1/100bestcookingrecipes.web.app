Masoor Dal ki Puri Jibita Khanna @Jibitakhanna I love this Masoor Dal stuffed Puri and has been my favourite since childhood when mom and grandma used to make for breakfast on Sundays. We usually have it with chutney &amp; my favourite is the garlic tomato chutney but it goes well with coriander green chutney too and potato curry too. This popular Indian recipe features lovely red lentils cooked with onions, tomatoes, and lots of rich and savory spices.
