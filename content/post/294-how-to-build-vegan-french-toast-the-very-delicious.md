##### Instructions to make [Vegan] French Toast:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

The frying pan should be very hot and the combination of the mix that you dip the bread in, plus the coconut oil creates the perfectly browned result you see here. Based in Los Angeles, Crossroads Kitchen opened its second location last year inside the Resorts World Las Vegas as the first plant-based. In a blender or food processor add the banana, coconut milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Pour the mixture into a shallow wide bowl that will fit a slice of bread. Tips for the bread: I like using a day-old or slightly stale bread.
