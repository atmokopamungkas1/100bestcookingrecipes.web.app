Great for pleasing guests and a perfect hit recipe for a party main course. The stuffed version does not take any longer if you prepare the stuffing while the potatoes are boiling. But it takes a little longer for the patties to stuff and shape. I make the plain ones more often for a evening snack and reserve the stuffed tikkis for occasions.
