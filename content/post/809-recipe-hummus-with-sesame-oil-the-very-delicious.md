##### Steps to make Hummus with Sesame Oil:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Olive oil makes the texture of the hummus luxurious. We also add a little drizzle to the top of the swirly hummus when we serve. Sesame is rich in oil and therefore, like any oil, will go rancid over time. So, that half empty can of tahini that has been sitting around in your fridge for a year? Probably not the best tasting anymore, and likely rancid..
