Hello everybody, it is Drew, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, eggplant parmesan. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

The combination of crunchy bread crumbs, tomato sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese is guaranteed to please! Eggplant Parmesan is one of those great Italian comfort foodsâ€”a layered casserole much like lasagna but with slices of globe eggplant taking the place of pasta. The two things to keep in mind when cooking eggplant, especially firm globe eggplants, is that not only do eggplants hold onto moisture, they also absorb oil like a sponge. Assemble in a baking dish: in a large casserole or baking dish, spread a layer of marinara and then top with one layer of breaded eggplant.

Eggplant Parmesan is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It's appreciated by millions daily. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. They're nice and they look fantastic. Eggplant Parmesan is something which I have loved my whole life.
