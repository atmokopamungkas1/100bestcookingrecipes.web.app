##### Steps to make Lentil and Sausage Soup:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

This dish is easy to make but does need a some time for preparation, This stew is delicious served with a simple salad or a slice or two of Italian crusty bread and a glass of red wine. A loaf of crusty bread is the only accompaniment you need for a complete meal. In a bowl whisk together eggs, milk, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper and set aside. When it comes to making stew that simmers all day in the slow cooker, French lentils deliver far better results than other varieties of lentils such as green, brown, or red. That&#39;s because small, dark-colored French lentils, which are a type of green lentil, hold their shape remarkably well, meaning they won&#39;t get mushy.
