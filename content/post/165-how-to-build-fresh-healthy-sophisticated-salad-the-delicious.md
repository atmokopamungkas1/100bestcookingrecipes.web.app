This cucumber chickpea salad with feta and lemon is tangy and refreshing. You can enjoy it on its own or toss it with greens for an easy lunch or dinner. We love the grassy flavor of dill, but another fresh herb like. Get your greens on Lettuce — The darker or redder, the better — so think romaine and leaf lettuces (vitamin C, folic acid, potassium).

##### Instructions to make Fresh healthy sophisticated salad :):


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

We love the grassy flavor of dill, but another fresh herb like. Get your greens on Lettuce — The darker or redder, the better — so think romaine and leaf lettuces (vitamin C, folic acid, potassium). Leafy greens — Jazz things up with spring mix, baby spinach and kale or arugula (beta-carotene, antioxidants). Pro tip: Steer clear of iceberg and other pale lettuces. The tang in this salad comes from the dressing made apple cider vinegar and mustard.
