Don&#39;t substitute double cream for mascarpone. There is no tiramisu without mascarpone. Mascarpone - it&#39;s a very thick, rich Italian cream that has a consistency like cream cheese (see video for consistency). Australians - do NOT use Woolworths or any generic home brand as they are too thin and won&#39;t set, so your cream layer will be too thin.
