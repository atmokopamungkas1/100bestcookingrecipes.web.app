A sprinkle of salt (or tamari) adds a bit of saltiness if needed, but I usually skip! It&#39;s a gorgeous bright orange hue, creamy, and spicy-sweet (my favorite). Cut your bread into bite-sized chunks. Combine the anchovy fillets, garlic, egg yolks, dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice in a blender or food processor.
